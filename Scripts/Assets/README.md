### Assets (i.e., reusable models/codes) 
This directory contains 3D model assets for Unity, Blender, and UE. 

Create a relevant subdirectory as you see it necessary. For example, your created C# function for a user interface can be put under "Unity/Functions" directory. 

**Make sure that your asset can be imported in a different project, and make a tutorial on how to use your asset (i.e., examples).**
