# Contains 3-D tutorial script files (from Blender, Unity, and/or Unreal Engine 5).
There is a separate repository, https://github.com/STEMin3D/Tutorials, that holds tutorial scripts demonstrating various functionalities of 3-D tools. These files are large in size and hence stored in the repository with the Large File Storage of GitHub.
