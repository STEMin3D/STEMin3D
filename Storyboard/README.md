# This directory holds `storyboard` files

A ''storyboard'' file in our project is similar to one in the movie industry. It is a visual outline of a simulation. It describes what happens scene by scene in the simulation, from the opening scene to the final ending, breaking down the key aspects into different panels like a comic book. It should contain drawings or images, camera direction, dialogue, and other crucial details.

Many softwares can be used in creating storyboard files. For example, a PowerPoint template can be a good starting point. [Storyboarder](https://wonderunit.com/storyboarder/) by WUNDER Unit is a free software that allows additions of images, annotations, camera settings, lights, and realistic human characters. We are developing storyboard files with Storyboarder.

Later on, after a simulation is created, storyboard file can guide a lecture on how to use the created simulation. For example, a storyboard file can outline a lesson plan on how to implement the simulation.
