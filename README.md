# Documentation
This repository holds various documentation files. 
"Documentation files" are your lab-note that summarize information such as 
  * comment on a specific task
  * ideas
  * todos

**A general guideline in creating 'documentation' for your task is the report should contain __enough details__ such that a 3rd person can reproduce your result just by following your report.**

If you are new to ''git'' or ''gh'', [this git cheatsheet](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf) can be useful.
