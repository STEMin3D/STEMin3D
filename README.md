# STEMin3D GitHub is an Enterprise
We have decided to transform the STEMin3D repositories into an Enterprise, and doing so will provide many benefits (near-infinite storage space, a dedicated domain name under UGA [e.g., stemin3d.uga.edu, etc.). 

With this change, all users need to activate the 2-factor authentication similar to the login processes using MyID. To activate the 2-factor authentication for your GitHub, [follow this instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication).
# STEMin3D GitHub Repository
This repository has three main subdirectories each of which holds specific files for the [STEMin3D Project](https://STEMin3D.net).

  * [Documentation Folder](Documentations): contains project notes
  * [Storyboard Folder](Storyboard): contains storyboard files
  * [Script Folder](Scripts): contains 3-D model scripts

In addition to these files, you can create any relevant files to hold information such as (1) a description of a specific task, (2) new ideas, (3) todos, (4) in-document discussion, (5) to-do items, etc.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your project note should contain *enough details* so that a 3rd person can reproduce your result just by following steps in your report.

## ðŸ‘€ A short tutorial on how to use git and this repository
The fact that you are reading this README file indicates that you already created your GitHub account. You will need to use your GitHub account information in step #3 below.

There are mainly two ways to use the git/repository: (1) the command-line approach in a terminal and (2) by using the [GitHub Desktop application](https://desktop.github.com/). This tutorial shows how to use our repository using the terminal approach. For using an app, you can find relevant tutorials by searching the internet.

`Step 1` First step is installing *Git* and *GitHub CLI*. Read [this tutorial](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) and https://cli.github.com/ to install them on your machine.

`Step 2` Open a *terminal* in your computer, and follow the rest of the steps below.

`Step 3` Because our repository is a __private__ one, one has to authenticate to access the content.
```shell
gh auth login
# Then, follow the directions on the terminal.
```

`Step 4` Change to your working directory and clone the STEMin3D repository using the following command. Cloning will create a directory, **STEMin3D**, and all relevant files are copied under this directory. 
Different options for cloning the repository (e.g., via HTTPS) are available and you can check those options by clicking `<> Code` in the menu bar on the GitHub homepage.
```shell
gh repo clone STEMin3D/STEMin3D
```
`Step 5` Start your work in the local directory. You may create a subdirectory(ies), create new files, 
delete some old no-longer-useful files, modify existing files, etc. After you finish your work, you need to 
synchronize the changes in your local directory to the remote repository. This step consists of two commands: "git commit .." + "git push".
```shell
git fetch               # download any changes from the repository. Always start your work with this command.
git add <new file>      # add a new file you created
git add -A              # add ALL changes
git rm <filename>       # remove a file
git status              # check the current status of the local directory
...
```

`Step 6` After finishing your work, copy over the changes to the online repository,
```shell
git commit -a     # this may bring up an editor window where you can add a commit log.
# Provide a short info on what changes are made.
git push          # Synchronize the remote repository with changes from your local directory.
```

`Step 7` Your daily work on the project should start with the command "git fetch" which will guarantee that your 
local directory is sync with the remote repository. The remote repository might have been changed since your 
previous work due to changes made by someone else or by yourself on another machine.

> [!TIP]
> Any git commands (or most commands) can have an option flag "-n" which means a dry-run. 
> When you want to check if a command runs OK but do not want to make actual changes, add this option. 
> ```shell
> git add -n <new_file>   # see if this command creates any error or warning (due to a possible conflict)
> git rm -n <a file>      # likewise..
> ```
